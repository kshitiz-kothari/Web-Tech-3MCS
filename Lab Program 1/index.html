    <h1><b>Chess</b></h1>
    <p>Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess"><h5>Read more about chess</a></h5></p>
    <h2><i>Principles</i></h2>

    <h2>Advantages of playing chess</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><h3><b>Chess increases your intelligence</b></h3></dt>
        <dd>- 
        People with lots of experience playing chess have highly developed thinking abilities in two areas (in addition to memory skills):
        <ul>
            <li><h4><b>Fluid intelligence</b></h4> This is the ability to consider new kinds of problems and use reasoning to solve them.</li>
            <li><h4><b>Processing speed</b></h4> This is the ability to swiftly comprehend tasks and respond efficiently to challenges.</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
        
        <dt><h3><b>Chess enables you to enter a flow state</b></h3></dt>
        <dd>- Flow is a deeply rewarding sense of total involvement, in which youâ€™re operating at a peak performance level in a challenging task. Athletes, artists, and performers often describe entering a kind of time warp, where they are so wholly focused on the task at hand that their awareness of anything beyond the performance seems to disappear.</dd>
